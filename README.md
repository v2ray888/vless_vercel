# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Default Admin Credentials

The database is seeded with a default administrator account. You can change the admin email in the `.env` file.

- **Email:** `admin@example.com` (or the value of `ADMIN_EMAIL` in your `.env` file)
- **Password:** `password`

Any other seeded user (e.g., `zhangsan@example.com`) also uses the password `password`.
